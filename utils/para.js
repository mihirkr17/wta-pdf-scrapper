Jasmine Paolini:
Paolini is the first Italian woman to reach the Wimbledon final in the Open Era; Italian women had previously
gone 0-4 in Wimbledon quarterfinals
Paolini is through to her second straight Grand Slam final this year (l. Swiatek in Roland Garros final); she had
not made a Grand Slam QF before this year
Paolini is the first Italian player in the Open Era to reach the final at two different Grand Slam events (Roland
Garros and Wimbledon)
Paolini is the fifth player since 1999 and first since Serena Williams in 2016 to reach the Women’s Singles
finals at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same year after Steffi Graf (1999), Serena Williams (2002, 2015,
2016), Venus Williams (2002) and Justine Henin (2006)
Since the WTA rankings were first published in 1975, Paolini is the first player ranked outside the Top 5 to
reach the final at Roland Garros and Wimbledon in the same year
Paolini has won eight matches on grass this season but was winless at tour-level on the surface prior to 2024
Paolini defeated three Top 50 players at Wimbledon this fortnight: No.37 Donna Vekic, No.19 Emma Navarro
and No.13 Madison Keys
Paolini is playing at a career-high No.7 after making maiden Grand Slam final at Roland Garros this season

last Italian ranked in the Top 5 was Sara Errani the weeks of August 23, 2013
Since WTA rankings were published in 1975, the highest rank achieved by an Italian woman is No.4 by
Francesa Schiavone
Paolini made her first grass semifinal last week at Eastbourne (l. eventual champion Kasatkina)
Paolini is the player with the most Grand Slam main draw wins in 2024 (15)
Only five players in the Open Era have lost both Roland Garros and Wimbledon final in the same year: Evonne
Goolagong (1972), Chris Evert (1973 and 1984), Olga Morozova (1974), Arantxa Sanchez Vicario (1995 and
1996) and Venus Williams (2002)
Paolini is the first Italian player in the Open Era to reach WTA level finals on hard (Dubai), clay (Roland
Garros) and grass (Wimbledon) courts in the same season
Paolini is the second player to make a WTA final on each surface this season, along with Daria Kasatkina
Paolini is the fourth player in the Open Era to reach her first two Grand Slam finals in  the same year at Roland
Garros and Wimbledon after Chris Evert (1973), Olga Morozova (1974) and Steffi Graf (1987)
Paolini is the second player in the Open Era to reach the Ladies’ Singles final at Wimbledon without a single
Wimbledon main draw match win entering the event after Justine Henin in 2001
Paolini could become the first player in the Open Era to secure the Ladies’ Singles title at Wimbledon without a
previous Wimbledon main draw win
Paolini could become the fourth player this century to win a Grand Slam title without a main draw win coming
into that year’s event after Jelena Ostapenko at the French Open in 2017, Bianca Andreescu at the US Open
2019 and Emma Raducanu at the US Open 2021
Paolini is looking to become the sixth player in the Open Era to win her first Ladies’ Singles title at Wimbledon
after having turned 28, after Ann Jones (1969), Virginia Wade (1977), Jana Novotna (1998), Marion Bartoli
(2013) and Angelique Kerber (2018)
Only Sara Errani in 2012 (17) won more Grand Slam main draw matches in a single year than Jasmine Paolini
in 2024 (15) amongst Italian players in the Open Era
Paolini’s semifinal against Donna Vekic was the longest Wimbledon Ladies semifinal match in the Open Era at
2 hrs 51 mins
